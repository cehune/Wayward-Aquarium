        description: 'The devil fish or giant devil ray (Mobula mobular) is a species of ray in the family Mobulidae. It is currently listed as endangered, mostly due to bycatch mortality in unrelated fisheries.' +
          'The devil fish is larger than its close relative the lesser devil ray. It grows to a length of disk 3.5 metres (11 ft), making it one of the largest rays. It possesses a spiny tail.[4] The devil fish is the third largest species in the genus Mobula, after the oceanic and reef manta rays. It is the only mobulid species that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The species has been observed to have a maximum recorded length of disk width of 5.2 meters (roughly 17 feet).[5] However, those data are unreliable and are allegedly misunderstood as Giant oceanic Manta Rays that have strayed into the Mediterranean.[6][7] It is also considered to be the only Devil fish with a tail spine.[6][7] The species is also considered endangered given its decreasing population density.[8]' +
          'The Devil fish is most common in the Mediterranean Sea. It is also found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest coast of Ireland and south of Portugal, as well as in the central and western Pacific Ocean.[4] In the Mediterranean Sea, the species has a basin-wide distribution[8] and is most frequent in the eastern Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea.[9] The large aggregations observed in the Levantine basin could signal an important mating area.[9]' +
          'Devil fish inhabit offshore areas to the neritic zone, their range as deep as several thousand meters.  They are typically observed in small clusters, and may occasionally form larger groups.[1]' +
          'Giant devil rays are usually seen in deep coastal waters but are occasionally seen in shallow waters. In a tagging experiment conducted by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), three giant devil rays were tagged and their depth was observed throughout different times of the day. The rays reached a maximum depth of 600–700 meters (1960–2300 feet) but mostly spent their time between 0 and 50 meters (0 and 165 feet); they prefer warmer waters with a temperature between 20 °C and 29 °C (68 °F and 84 °F). The giant devil rays also deep dive at random times, instances not correlated to the time of day unlike how other species deep dive at specific times of day.[5] In other observations studying ray abundance and habitat, giant devil rays were observed alone and occasionally in groups with a maximum of 18 rays. The same study also emphasizes that the rays undergo a species migration across the Mediterranean Sea with the seasons, taking advantage of warm, highly productive waters.[10]',
