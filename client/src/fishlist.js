    description: "Atlantic wahoo grow fast, up to 8 feet and 158 pounds, though they are commonly between 3.3 and 5.4 feet long.They have a short life span, up to 5 or 6 years.They are able to reproduce at about 1 year old. For males, this is when they reach 2.8 feet in length, and for females, when they reach 3.3 feet.Atlantic wahoo spawn multiple times throughout the spawning season.They are very productive, releasing a half-million to 45 million eggs per year to compensate for eggs that might not survive to adulthood.They mainly feed on squid and fish, including frigate mackerel, butterfish, porcupine fish, and round herring. They generally compete with tuna, but can feed on larger prey by using their extremely sharp teeth to render prey into bite-size pieces.A number of predators that share their habitat feed on young wahoo.",
    status: "There are four stocks of wahoo: a South Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico stock, a Puerto Rico stock, a St. Croix stock, and a St. Thomas/St. John stock. According to the most recent stock assessments:The South Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico stock has not been assessed and the population status and fishing rateare unknown. However, catch limits are in place for this stock.The Puerto Rico stock has not been assessed so the population size is unknown, but the stock is not subject to overfishing based on 2019 catch data.The St. Croixstock has not been assessed so the population size is unknown, but the stock is not subject to overfishing based on 2021catch data.The St. Thomas/St. Johnstock has not been assessed so the population size is unknown, but the stock is not subject to overfishing based on 2021catch data.Atlantic wahoo can handle relatively high fishing rates, but precautionary management seeks to maintain current harvest levels.",

    health_benefits: "Atlantic wahoo is an excellent source of low-fat protein.",
    quote: "U.S. wild-caught Atlantic wahoo is a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed and responsibly harvested under U.S. regulations.",
