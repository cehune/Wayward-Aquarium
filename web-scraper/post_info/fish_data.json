        "description": "The devil fish or giant devil ray (Mobula mobular) is a species of ray in the family Mobulidae. It is currently listed as endangered, mostly due to bycatch mortality in unrelated fisheries. The devil fish is larger than its close relative the lesser devil ray. It grows to a length of disk 3.5 metres (11 ft), making it one of the largest rays. It possesses a spiny tail.[4] The devil fish is the third largest species in the genus Mobula, after the oceanic and reef manta rays. It is the only mobulid species that lives in the Mediterranean Sea. The species has been observed to have a maximum recorded length of disk width of 5.2 meters (roughly 17 feet).[5] However, those data are unreliable and are allegedly misunderstood as Giant oceanic Manta Rays that have strayed into the Mediterranean.[6][7] It is also considered to be the only Devil fish with a tail spine.[6][7] The species is also considered endangered given its decreasing population density.[8] The Devil fish is most common in the Mediterranean Sea. It is also found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the southwest coast of Ireland and south of Portugal, as well as in the central and western Pacific Ocean.[4] In the Mediterranean Sea, the species has a basin-wide distribution[8] and is most frequent in the eastern Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea.[9] The large aggregations observed in the Levantine basin could signal an important mating area.[9] Devil fish inhabit offshore areas to the neritic zone, their range as deep as several thousand meters.  They are typically observed in small clusters, and may occasionally form larger groups.[1] Giant devil rays are usually seen in deep coastal waters but are occasionally seen in shallow waters. In a tagging experiment conducted by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), three giant devil rays were tagged and their depth was observed throughout different times of the day. The rays reached a maximum depth of 600–700 meters (1960–2300 feet) but mostly spent their time between 0 and 50 meters (0 and 165 feet); they prefer warmer waters with a temperature between 20 °C and 29 °C (68 °F and 84 °F). The giant devil rays also deep dive at random times, instances not correlated to the time of day unlike how other species deep dive at specific times of day.[5] In other observations studying ray abundance and habitat, giant devil rays were observed alone and occasionally in groups with a maximum of 18 rays. The same study also emphasizes that the rays undergo a species migration across the Mediterranean Sea with the seasons, taking advantage of warm, highly productive waters.[10]",

        "description": "American lobsters have a long life span. It’s difficult to determine their exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt, leaving no evidence of age. But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.They can weigh up to 44 pounds.Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny floating animals) during their first year.Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs. Young lobsters are especially vulnerable to predators. Large, hard-shelled lobsters may be immune to predators (except humans).",

Bocaccio mature and begin to reproduce between ages 4 and 7 years old, and they can live to be 50 years old.Bocaccio larvae are opportunistic feeders. Early on, larvae mostly eat copepod nauplii and eat some invertebrate eggs. As they grow, larvae start eating copepodites, adult copepods, and euphausiids.Within the first year of their lives, bocaccio begin foraging on other young fishes.Adult bocaccio mostly eat fish. Their preferred meal is other rockfishes, but they will also eat sablefish, anchovies, lantern fish and squid.Female bocaccio may spawn one to three times per season. They are highly fecund for rockfish and have been recorded with anywhere from 290 thousand up to 1.9 million eggs in the ovaries at one time.In the Southern California Bight, Bocaccio spawn from October to July, peaking in January.

        "description": "Pink salmon are anadromous – they hatch in freshwater streams and rivers then migrate out to the saltwater environment of the ocean to feed and grow.Unlike \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/coho-salmon\"coho, \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/chinook-salmon\"Chinook, or \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/sockeye-salmon\"sockeye salmon, pink salmon do not reside in fresh water for an extended period.Young pink salmon (fry) typically migrate directly to estuarine and marine waters soon after they are born.Once they reach the ocean, they feed voraciously and grow rapidly. In fact, they’re among the fastest growing of the Pacific salmon species.After about 1½ years of feeding and growing in the ocean, maturing pink salmon return to fresh water to spawn, usually from August to October.Females construct nests (redds) in the riverbed by turning on their sides and vigorously flexing their bodies and tails, digging a shallow hole.Females deposit between 1,200 and 1,900 eggs in the redds, which the males then fertilize.The female stays and defends her redd from other females until she dies, usually within two weeks.All pink salmon die after they spawn.They typically spawn at the age of 2.Because the pink salmon life cycle is so regular, independent populations spawn in even and odd years. For example, in the southern part of their range, they usually spawn in odd yearsin most river systems. However, pink salmon do spawn in even years in some Puget Sound rivers.Throughout most of Alaska, there is no dominant year, except in the northwestern part of Alaska where even-year runs predominate.Pink salmon feed on small crustaceans, zooplankton (tiny floating animals), squid, and small fish.In fresh water, aquatic invertebrates, other fishes, birds, and small mammals prey on pink salmon eggs, alevins, and fry.In the ocean, other fishes (including other Pacific salmon) and coastal seabirds prey on pink salmon fry and juveniles.Marine mammals, sharks, other fishes (such as \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-halibut\"Pacific halibut), and humpback whales feed on adult pink salmon.In freshwater spawning habitats, bears are predators of adult pink salmon. Wolves, river otters, and bald eagles will also occasionally eat pre-spawning adult pinks.After salmon spawn and die, \"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=97&amp;issue_id=21\" rel=\"external\"salmon carcasses are a valuable source of energy and nutrients to the river ecosystem. Carcasses have been shown to improve newly hatched salmon growth and survival by contributing nitrogen and phosphorous compounds to streams.",
        "status": "Alaska:Pink salmon are the most abundant Pacific salmon.The Alaska Coho Salmon Assemblage consists of coho salmon, sockeye salmon, pink salmon, and chum salmon throughout southeast Alaska.

They transform to females at about 3½ years old.They start spawning in late July in offshore waters, mainly in deep mud basins in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. By early fall, most adult females have pushed their eggs out onto their abdomen.In late fall through winter, egg-bearing females move inshore where the eggs hatch. Juveniles remain in coastal waters for a year or more before migrating to deeper offshore waters, where they mature as males.Their reproductive success, growth, and development can be affected by temperature. They can grow up to 3 or 4 inches long, and most do not live past age 5.They prey on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals) and bottom-dwelling invertebrates.They are eaten by many important fish species such as cod, redfish, and silver and white hake.Northern shrimp are an important part of the marine food chain, and maintaining a healthy population is important to supporting a balanced Gulf of Maine ecosystem.",

Depending on their size, females have between 2 million and 3 million eggs per spawning season.Similarly sized albacore travel together in schools that can be up to 19 miles wide. Schools of albacore also sometimes include other tuna species such as skipjack, yellowfin, and bluefin.Albacore constantly swim with their mouths open in order to breathe because they lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water over their gills.They have unique biological characteristics that enable them to swim at speeds over 50 miles per hour and cover vast areas during annual migrations:Torpedo-shaped bodies, smooth skin, and streamlined fins.Highly evolved circulatory system that regulates body temperature and increases muscle efficiency.High metabolism.High blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which increase oxygen absorption.Albacore tuna feed near the top of the food chain, preying upon a variety of fish, crustaceans, and squid.They are prey for many top predators, including sharks, rays, larger tunas, and billfishes.",

Females release their hatched larvae from late spring through July and August.Females generally produce between 15,000 and 20,000 larvae per spawning cycle.Newly hatched redfish can swim well at birth and are soon able to forage for plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Their survival rate is relatively high compared with that of egg-laying fish.Young redfish stay in the upper waters feeding on small crustaceans until they are about 2 inches long.In the fall, the young settle to the ocean bottom.Older redfish feed on larger invertebrates and small fish.",

They grow quickly for the first few years of their life.The largest scallop ever reported was about 9 inches in shell height, but they typically don’t grow larger than 6 inches.Sea scallops can reproduce by age 2, but don’t produce many eggs or sperm until they are about 4 years old.They are very fertile—a female sea scallop can produce hundreds of millions of eggs per year. For this reason, scallops may respond more rapidly to management actions than species that reproduce slowly and in small numbers.Sea scallops usually spawn in late summer or early fall. They also may spawn in the spring, especially in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.After hatching, scallop larvae remain in the water column for 4 to 6 weeks before settling on the ocean floor.Sea scallops feed by filtering phytoplankton or other small organisms out of the water column, which can actually help to improve water quality by removing suspended materials.Many kinds of pelagic fish and invertebrates eat scallop larvae.Cod, wolffish, eel pout, flounder, crabs, lobster, sea turtles, and sea stars feed on juvenile and adult scallops.Using its adductor muscle to snap its top and bottom shells open and shut, a sea scallop can propel itself through the water. This helps them escape predators, such as sea stars, that other bivalves like mussels, clams, and oysters can’t avoid.",

Squid hatched in the summer grow faster than those hatched in the winter.They spawn year-round, with peak production in winter and summer. The male cements bundles of spermatophores into the mantle cavity of the female and/or deposits them in a pouch located near her mouth. The spermatophores penetrate the ova, or sperm is stored for later use.The female lays fertilized egg capsules that contain about 150 to 200 eggs each in clusters attached to the ocean bottom, with a typical female laying a total of 3,000 to 6,000 eggs. Eggs hatch between 11 and 26 days later, depending on water temperature.Small immature longfin squid feed on plankton, and larger squid feed on crustaceans and small fish.They are aggressive hunters, can consume fish larger than themselves, and do eat their own species.They are a key prey species for a variety of marine mammals, diving birds, and finfish species.",

Pacific mackerel spawn from late April to September off California, year-round off central Baja California peaking from June through October, and from late fall to early spring off Cabo San Lucas.They spawn several times a year, releasing batches of almost 70,000 eggs each time. The eggs usually hatch within 4 to 5 days.Pacific mackerel feed on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals) and the younger stages of all the pelagic species such as anchovies and sardines, as well as their own young.Various larger fish (such as sharks and tunas), marine mammals, and seabirds eat Pacific mackerel.Pacific mackerel school as a defense against predators. Often they will school with other pelagic species such as jack mackerel and sardines.As adults, they migrate north to Washington in the summer and south to Baja California in the winter. The northerly movement in summer is accentuated during El Niño events.They also travel inshore and offshore off California—they’re more abundant inshore from July to November and more abundant offshore from March to May.",

However, in historical terms, the population remains at a relatively low abundance level, due primarily to oceanographic conditions.",

The oldest observed blacktip shark was 15.5 years old.They often form large groups, segregated into separate schools of males and females when they are not mating. They mate between March and June.Males mature at 4 to 5 years of age, while females mature later, at 6 to 7 years of age.Females have an 11- to 12-month gestation period and give birth to an average of three pups per litter in the Atlantic and four to five pups per litter in the Gulf of Mexico.Pups are born in shallow nursery grounds away from the adult population. After giving birth, the females leave the nursery area while juveniles remain.Blacktip sharks eat bony fishes, smaller sharks, squids, stingrays, shrimp, and crabs. They often follow fishing boats and are sometimes seen consuming discarded fish.",

Every year, an average-sized female produces around 850,000 eggs, and larger females can produce up to 3 million eggs.Females release their eggs in batches near the ocean floor, where a courting male fertilizes them.Once fertilized, eggs rise to the surface where they drift with ocean currents.Newly hatched haddock remain near the surface for several months before they settle to the bottom.Haddock feed on a variety of bottom-dwelling animals, including mollusks, worms, crustaceans, sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle stars, and occasional fish eggs.Adults sometimes eat small fish, especially herring.Spiny dogfish, skates, and many groundfish species (cod, pollock, cusk, hake, monkfish, halibut, and sea raven) prey on juvenile haddock.

Females are able to reproduce when they’re 8 to 9 feet long and 4 to 5 years of age.Common thresher sharks mate in late summer. Eggs are fertilized internally and develop within the mother. Females bear live, fully developed young after a long gestation period (9 months), and only have a few pups.Common thresher sharks are aggressive predators that feed near the top of the food chain on schooling fish such as herring and mackerel and occasionally on squid and seabirds.They are named for their long, scythe-like tail, which is used to stun fish before preying on them.Adult common thresher sharks have few predators, but younger, smaller ones may fall prey to larger sharks.",

They are known to spawn in large numbers from January through March off south-central California, and were traditionally thought to migrate seasonally. However, recent studies have also shown that they may spawn as far north as Canada.In the spring, they travel nearshore and to the north to feed along the continental shelf and slope from northern California to Vancouver Island.In the summer, they form large schools along the continental shelf break. In years with warmer water temperatures, whiting tend to move farther north during the summer. Older whiting tend to migrate farther than younger fish.Female whiting are able to reproduce when they reach 2 to 4 years old (13 to 16 inches long). Males mature by 3 years of age (11 inches long).Females release their eggs, which males then fertilize externally. Eggs hatch in 5 to 6 days.They feed on shrimp, krill, and pelagic schooling fish, such as eulachon and Pacific herring. As whiting grow larger, fish make up a greater part of their diet.Many fish-eating species, such as \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/lingcod\"lingcod and Humboldt squid, prey on Pacific whiting.

Females can have 500,000 to 1.5 million eggs over the spawning season.Spanish mackerel swim in large, fast-moving schools.They migrate as the seasons and water temperatures change.Along the Atlantic coast, Spanish mackerel spend the winter off Florida and move northward to North Carolina in early April and to New York in June. As waters cool later in the year, they return south to Florida waters.In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, they migrate to the west of Cape San Blas, Florida. They remain in the northern Gulf of Mexico until September and migrate south along the coast in the fall.Spanish mackerel prey primarily on herring, menhaden, sardines, mullet, needlefish, and anchovy and, to a lesser degree, shrimp, crabs, and squid.

        "description": "Market squid are fast-growing animals with a short natural life span. They reach up to 1 foot in total length, including their arms.They reproduce right before they die, around the age of 1 year.They spawn year-round. Spawning occurs April through October in central California and October through the end of April or May in southern California.Spawning squid congregate in large schools near their spawning grounds, usually over sandy habitats.Males deposit spermatophores into females, and the eggs are fertilized as females release them. Females produce about 20 egg cases, with each case containing about 200 individual eggs.Females deposit eggs on sandy habitats, building large mounds of egg cases. Eggs take several days to months to hatch, depending on temperature.Newly hatched eggs are called “paralarvae” and resemble miniature adults.Juvenile market squid feed on small crustaceans. As they grow, they feed on krill, small crustaceans, small fish, and other squid.Market squid are a critical food source for a variety of fish (salmon, \"https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/lingcod\"lingcod,aand rockfish), seabirds, and marine mammals.",

As a result, market squid populations can handle a relatively high amount of fishing pressure.Ensuring that fishermen capture squid that have already spawned is key to the production of the next generation and future health of the population.The overfishing status is unknown.",

When suitable prey appears, flounder ambush them.Larval and juvenile summer flounder are preyed upon until they grow large enough to fend for themselves.

Red grouper are unspecialized and opportunistic feeders – they eat any convenient prey. They engulf prey whole by opening their large mouths, dilating their gill covers, rapidly drawing in a current of water, and inhaling the food.Smaller grouper are preyed on by the same predators that eat snappers, including jacks, other groupers, sharks, barracudas, and morays.

They molt about 25 times in their first 5 to 7 years of life, and once per year when they’re older. It takes them about 2 years to grow to the 3-inch carapace (shell) legal-harvesting size.Spiny lobsters may live 15 years or more, but there is uncertainty regarding this estimate due to the difficulty in ageing this species.They can grow up to 15 pounds and 18 inches.Females can reproduce when they reach 2.75 to 3 inches carapace length in the southeastern United States, and 3.6 inches in the Caribbean.They spawn from March through August in the Florida Keys on offshore reefs, and spawn throughout the year in the Caribbean.The male spiny lobster deposits sperm packets on the underside of the female. She scratches them to release sperm as she releases her eggs (between 230,000 to 2.6 million eggs each time they spawn, depending on her size). The female carries the fertilized eggs beneath her tail, and is referred to as “berried.” The eggs hatch in about 3 weeks.Most of the spiny lobster larvae found in U.S. waters are from upstream sources in the Caribbean.Young spiny lobsters feed on soft-bodied plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).Juveniles and adults are carnivores, preying on snails, crabs, and clams. They are nocturnal, inhabiting coral reefs, burrows, and dens during the day and foraging for food at night.Many predators feed on juvenile and adult spiny lobster, including groupers, snappers, sharks, skates, turtles, and octopuses.",

They move into inshore waters off the U.S. Pacific coast by late summer, then spend late fall and winter in the western Pacific Ocean. The timing and distance of their migrations in a given year depend on oceanic conditions.Less is known about the movements of albacore in the South Pacific Ocean – juveniles move southward from the tropics when they are about a foot long, and then eastward to about 130˚ West. When the fish are mature, they return to tropical and subtropical waters to spawn.They’re able to reproduce when they reach 5 to 6 years old, and they live for 10 to 12 years.North Pacific albacore spawn between March and July in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific. Females broadcast their eggs near the surface, where they’re fertilized. Depending on their size, females release between 800,000 and 2.6 million eggs every time they spawn.Albacore can swim at speeds exceeding 50 miles per hour and cover vast areas during annual migrations.They have a highly evolved circulatory system that regulates their body temperature and increases muscle efficiency; a high metabolism; and high blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which increase oxygen absorption.They lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water over their gills so, in order to breathe, they must constantly swim with their mouths open.Albacore are top carnivores, preying on schooling stocks such as sardine, anchovy, and squid. They eat an enormous amount of food to fuel their high metabolism, sometimes consuming as much as 25 percent of their own weight every day.Larger species of billfish, tuna, and sharks eat albacore.",

They have determinate growth and reach maximum shell length before sexual maturation; thereafter the shell grows only in thickness. Size at maturity can vary depending on environmental conditions.Queen conch have a protracted spawning season of 4 to 9 months, with peak spawning during warmer months. They reproduce through internal fertilization, meaning individuals must be in contact to mate.Females can store fertilized eggs for several weeks, and eggs may be fertilized by multiple males. Egg laying takes 24 to 36 hours, with each egg mass containing about 750,000 eggs. After an incubation period of about 5 days the eggs hatch, and the veligers (larvae) drift in the water column from 21 to 30 days before settling to the bottom and metamorphosing into the adult form.Queen conch are slow moving marine snails that require direct contact to mate and these life history traits make them vulnerable to depensatory processes which impact reproductive success and impedes recovery of depleted populations.Larval conch feed on phytoplankton, juvenile conch feed primarily on seagrass detritus macroalgae and organic material in the sediment, and adults feed primarily on different types of filamentous algae.",

        "description": "Spiny dogfish live a long time, sometimes more than 80 years.They grow slowly, up to more than 4 feet and 22 pounds, although adults are generally 2½ to 3½ feet long.Spiny dogfish aren’t able to reproduce until they’re older – females mature at an average age of 35, males mature at an average age of 19.Female spiny dogfish are internally fertilized, and pups are retained in utero for 18 to 22 months. Depending on their size, female spiny dogfish can have up to 22 pups each reproductive cycle.Females generally release their young during the fall in shallow bays.The newborn pups range in length from 8½ to 12 inches.Spiny dogfish are opportunistic feeders, eating whatever prey is available. They mainly eat small, schooling pelagic fish such as herring, and small invertebrates such as shrimp, crab, and squid.They are preyed upon by larger species of shark, including larger spiny dogfish, and by larger fishes (such as cod and hake), seals, and killer whales.",

Eggs hatch after 12 to 20 days,dependent on water temperature.The larvae slowly float close to the surface, where they remain for about 6 months until they reach their adult form and settle to the bottom in shallow water.Larval Pacific halibut feed on zooplankton (tiny floating organisms).Juveniles eat small crustaceans and other organisms that live on the seafloor.Halibut live to be relatively old – the oldest halibut on record was 55 years old, but halibut over age 25 are rare.Adults aggressively prey on a variety of groundfish, sculpins, sand lance, herring, octopus, crabs, clams, and occasionally smaller Pacific halibut.Marine mammals and sharks sometimes eat Pacific halibut but, due to their large size, adult Pacific halibut are rarely preyed upon by other fish.",

The spawning season is sometimes extended over a number of months as quahogs release eggs and sperm a little at a time.Ocean quahogs are among the longest-lived marine organisms in the world. Off the U.S. East Coast, where the fishery takes place, ocean quahogs can live for at least 200 years.They grow very slowly and do not start to reproduce until around age 6, and do not reach a commercially harvestable size until about age 20.Ocean quahogs are filter feeders. They bury themselves in the ocean floor and pump oxygen-filled water and food particles in through their siphons, which extend above the surface of the ocean floor.They feed on microscopic algae.Many animals prey on juvenile ocean quahogs, including invertebrates such as rock crabs, sea stars, and other crustaceans, and fish such as longhorn sculpin, ocean pout, haddock, and cod.Once ocean quahogs have reached a certain size, they have a very low predation rate. They burrow in the sandy ocean floor and their thick shells close completely, providing substantial protection from potential predators.",

        "description": "Triggerfish can grow to be up to 13 pounds, 28 inches fork length (length from the tip of the snout to the center of the fork of the tail), and 16 years old.Males are larger than females.Triggerfish become sexually mature at approximately 2 years old.Spawning occurs from April to August. Male gray triggerfish establish territories, build nests in the sand, and entice females into the nest to spawn. The male and female tightly circle one another in the nest, rapidly changing color, and the female deposits eggs in the nest shortly afterward.Females deposit an average of 772,415 eggs. After fertilization females aerate the eggs by fanning and blowing on them.One male can defend up to three active nests on one reef. An active nest is defined as one female on the nest guarding and aerating the eggs. Females also guard the nest from predators, such as wrasses, groupers, and red snappers.Eggs hatch within 24 to 48 hours and the larvae travel to the surface, where they often live among mats of planktonic (open ocean) emSargassum, /ema floating brown algae.Larvae and juveniles spend 4 to 7 months in the planktonic environment before they move to the ocean bottom.Adults primarily eat benthic invertebrates including crabs, sea urchins, shrimp, sand dollars, lobsters, and mollusks. They have a small mouth with a strong jaw and specialized teeth used to crush and chisel holes in their hard-shelled prey. Gray triggerfish sometimes direct a stream of water over sandy ocean bottom habitat to expose sand dollars to eat. Juvenile gray triggerfish feed on hydroids, barnacles, and polychaetes.Amberjack, grouper, and sharks prey upon adult gray triggerfish; tuna, dolphinfish, marlin, sailfish, and sharks prey upon juvenile gray triggerfish.",

Females can produce 400,000 to 1.5 million eggs.They spawn from November to April in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Spawning begins slightly earlier in California.Petrale sole is a broadcast spawner. Males and females release their sperm and eggs into the water column and eggs are fertilized externally.Eggs hatch in 6 to 13.5 days, depending on water temperatures.Petrale sole larvae spend their first 5 to 6 months up in the water column before they transform to their adult form and settle to the bottom.Petrale sole larvae eat plankton. Small juveniles eat mysids, sculpins, and other juvenile flatfish. Large juveniles and adults eat shrimp and other crustaceans, as well as krill, pelagic fishes, brittle stars, and juvenile petrale sole.Plankton-eating invertebrates and pelagic fishes eat petrale sole eggs. Adult petrale sole and other large flatfishes prey on juvenile petrale sole.Sharks, bottom-feeding marine mammals, larger flatfishes, and pelagic fishes feed on adults.",

Scientists believe that the females briefly visit these spawning areas during winter and spring and only stay long enough to deposit their eggs in crevices and under ledges.Males guard the nests for 8 to 10 weeks until the eggs hatch. The presence of a male to guard the nest from predators appears essential for successful spawning. If something happens to the male, an unguarded nest can be decimated within 48 hours by feeding rockfish, starfish, sculpins, kelp greenling, and cod.Larvae feed on zooplankton (tiny floating animals), including krill and larval crustaceans such as lobster and crab. Juveniles feed on small fish.Adults are aggressive predators and feed primarily on bottom-dwelling fish (including smaller lingcod), squid, octopi, and crab.Marine mammals, sharks, and larger lingcod prey on juvenile and adult lingcod.",

        "description": "Most sockeye salmon are anadromous—they hatch in freshwater streams and rivers or lakes and generally rear in freshwater lakes for 1 to 3 years, after which they reach the smolt stage and migrate to the ocean to feed and grow.They typically mature and return to fresh water after 2 to 3 years at sea, but some return earlier or stay at sea longer, between 4 and 5 years.Sockeye salmon that return earlier are almost always males and are called \"jacks.\"They typically spawn in the summer or fall.Females select spawning sites, dig nests (redds) with their tails, and deposit eggs (between 2,000 and 4,500) in the redds.Males swim over the redds and fertilize the eggs.Females cover their eggs with gravel using their tails.The eggs hatch during the winter, and the newly hatched salmon (alevins) remain in the gravel, living off the material stored in their yolk sacs until early spring.They then emerge as fry and spend 1 to 3 years in fresh water before reaching the smolt stage and migrating out to the ocean, usually in the spring.All sockeye salmon die within a few weeks after spawning.They sexually mature around the age of 5, which means their lifespan is about 5 years, although some live longer. Age 4 is more common in the Pacific Northwest.While in fresh water, juvenile sockeye salmon feed mainly on zooplankton (tiny floating animals), amphipods (small, shrimp-like crustaceans), and insects.In the ocean, sockeye salmon continue to feed on zooplankton but also eat larval and small adult fishes and occasionally squid.Fish (including other salmon) and birds feed on juvenile salmon.Sharks, lampreys, and marine mammals prey on adult salmon in the ocean. Bears, eagles, and occasionally wolves feed on sockeye salmon in fresh water.After salmon spawn and die, \"http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=97&amp;issue_id=21\" rel=\"external\"salmon carcasses are a valuable source of energy and nutrients to the river ecosystem.

Females live to at least 13 years and grow to more than 4½ feet long, while males only live about 7 years and grow to almost 3 feet long.Males and females are able to reproduce when they reach about 14 inches and 16 inches long, respectively.Monkfish spawn from February to October.Females release large egg veils that can contain more than 1 million eggs.These egg veils float near the surface along with the prevailing currents for 1 to 3 weeks (depending on temperature) until the veil disintegrates and the larvae hatch.Monkfish migrate seasonally to spawn and feed.They travel by slowly swimming or by using the sturdy base of their pectoral fins to walk.Scientists speculate that their wing-like pectoral fins may be used to ride currents.Monkfish are opportunistic feeders, eating whatever prey is most available at the time.Larvae feed on zooplankton (tiny floating animals). Juveniles mostly eat small fish, shrimp, and squid.Adults mainly eat fish, including other monkfish, but also feed on crustaceans, mollusks, seabirds, and diving ducks.Monkfish ambush their prey—they use a modified spine on their head as a fishing pole and bait to lure small fish toward their mouths.When the prey comes near, the monkfish takes a large gulp, which sucks the prey into its mouth and traps it behind rows of back-pointing teeth.Large monkfish have few predators.Predacious fish such as swordfish, sharks, and thorny skate prey on small monkfish.",

        "name": "American Paddlefish",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_paddlefish",
        "description": "The American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula, also known as a Mississippi paddlefish, spoon-billed cat, or spoonbill) is a species of ray-finned fish. It is the only living species of paddlefish (Polyodontidae). This family is most closely related to the sturgeons; together they make up the order Acipenseriformes, which are one of the most primitive living groups of ray-finned fish. Fossil records of other paddlefish species date back 125 million years to the Early Cretaceous, with records of Polyodon extending back 65 million years to the early Paleocene. The American paddlefish is a smooth-skinned freshwater fish with an almost entirely cartilaginous skeleton and a paddle-shaped rostrum (snout), which extends nearly one-third its body length. It has been referred to as a freshwater shark because of its heterocercal tail or caudal fin resembling that of sharks, though it is not closely related.[7] The American paddlefish is a highly derived fish because it has evolved specialised adaptations such as filter feeding. Its rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, its primary food source. The only other species of paddlefish that survived to modern times was the Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius), last sighted in 2003 in the Yangtze River in China and considered to have gone extinct no later than 2010.\nThe American paddlefish is native to the Mississippi river basin and once moved freely under the relatively unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. It commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, braided channels, backwaters, and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf Coast drainages. Its peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes, with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 1917.[8][9] American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Poaching has also been a contributing factor to its decline and is liable to continue to be so as long as the demand for caviar remains strong. Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range, as well as from New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They have been reintroduced in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio river systems in western Pennsylvania. However, their current range has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. American paddlefish are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and are protected under state, federal and international laws.\nIn 1797, French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède established the genus Polyodon for paddlefish,[4] which today includes a single extant species, Polyodon spathula. Lacépède disagreed with Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre's description in Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique (1788), which had suggested that paddlefish were a species of shark. When Lacépède established his binomial name Polydon feuille he was unaware the species had already been described in 1792 by taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum, who had named it as Squalus spathula.[3][10][11] Consequently spathula has priority as the specific name (and 'Walbaum, 1792' is the taxonomic authority to be cited).[12] But Walbaum's generic name Squalus was already in use for dogfish, so Lacépède's Polyodon is the valid name for this paddlefish genus. Hence 'Polyodon spathula (Walbaum, 1792)' is the accepted full scientific name of the American paddlefish.[13]\n",

        "description": "The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a species of tilapia, a cichlid fish native to the northern half of Africa and the Levante area, including Israel, and Lebanon.[2] Numerous introduced populations exist outside its natural range.[1][3] It is also commercially known as mango fish, nilotica, or boulti.[4] The first name leads to easy confusion with another tilapia which is traded commercially, the mango tilapita (Sarotherodon galilaeus).\nThe Nile tilapia reaches up to 60 cm (24 in) in length,[2] and can exceed 5 kg (11 lb).[5] As typical of tilapia, males reach a larger size and grow faster than females.[5]\nWild, natural-type Nile tilapias are brownish or grayish overall, often with indistinct banding on their body, and the tail is vertically striped. When breeding, males become reddish, especially on their fins.[5][6] Although commonly confused with the blue tilapita (O. aureus), that species lacks the striped tail pattern, has a red edge to the dorsal fin (this edge is gray or black in Nile tilapia), and males are bluish overall when breeding. The two species can also be separated by meristics.[6] Because many tilapia in aquaculture and introduced around the world are selectively bred variants and/or hybrids,  identifying them using the standard features that can be used in the wild, natural types often is not possible.[6] The virtually unknown O. ismailiaensis has a plain tail, but otherwise closely resembles (and may only be a variant of) the Nile tilapia.[7]  Regardless, O. ismailiaensis might be extinct, as its only known habitat in northeastern Egypt has disappeared,[8] although similar-looking individuals (perhaps the same) are known from the vicinity.[7]\n",

Dull-colored, the Mozambique tilapia often lives up to a decade in its native habitats. It is a popular fish for aquaculture. Due to human introductions, it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an invasive species because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations.  It is known as the black tilapia in Colombia[2] and as the blue kurper in South Africa.[3]\nThe native Mozambique tilapia is laterally compressed, and has a deep body with long dorsal fins, the front part of which have spines. Native coloration is a dull greenish or yellowish, and weak banding may be seen. Adults reach up to 39 cm (15 in) in standard length and up to 1.1 kg (2.4 lb).[4] Size and coloration may vary in captive and naturalized populations due to environmental and breeding pressures. It lives up to 11 years.[4]\nThe Mozambique tilapia is native to inland and coastal waters in southeastern Africa, from the Zambezi Basin in Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe to the Bushman River in South Africa's Eastern Cape province.[1][5]  It is threatened in its home range by the introduced Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In addition to competing for the same resources, the two readily hybridize.[1][6] This has already been documented from the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers, and it is expected that pure Mozambique tilapia eventually will disappear from both.[1]\n",

It is one of the most intensively exploited fishes in fish farming, with an annual worldwide production of over three million tonnes in 2013, principally from China.[2] Unlike the omnivorous common carp, bighead carp are primarily filter-feeders, preferentially consuming zooplankton but also phytoplankton and detritus.\nThe bighead carp has a large, scaleless head, a large mouth, and eyes located very low on the head. Adults usually have a mottled silver-gray coloration. It is a large fish; a typical length is 60 cm (2 ft), and maximum observed size of 146 cm (4 ft 9 in) and 40 kg (88 lb).[3]\nBighead carp are native to large rivers and are associated with floodplain lakes of eastern Asia. Their range extends from southern China north to the Amur River system, which forms the border between China and Russia.[4] They have been introduced widely outside their native range, including in the United States, where they are considered invasive[3] as they out-compete native species (e.g. Bigmouth Buffalo).[5] They are also found in the Nile in North Africa.\n",

        "description": "The Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas), also known as jumbo squid or jumbo flying squid (EN), and Pota in Peru or Jibia in Chile (ES) is a large, predatory squid living in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is the only known species of the genus Dosidicus of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, family Ommastrephidae.[3]\nHumboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in), making the species the largest member of its family. They are the most important squid worldwide for commercial fisheries, with the catch predominantly landed in Chile, Peru and Mexico, however, a 2015 warming waters fishery collapse in the Gulf of California remains unrecovered.[4][5] Like other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae, they possess chromatophores which enable them to quickly change body coloration, known as 'metachrosis’ which is the  rapid flash of their skin from red to white. They have a relatively short lifespan of just 1–2 years. They have a reputation for aggression toward humans, although this behavior may only occur during feeding times.\nThey are most commonly found at depths of 200 to 700 m (660 to 2,300 ft), from Tierra del Fuego to California. This species is spreading north into the waters of the Pacific Northwest, in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska.\n",

        "description": "The Japanese flying squid, Japanese common squid or Pacific flying squid,[3] scientific name Todarodes pacificus, is a squid of the family Ommastrephidae. This animal lives in the northern Pacific Ocean, in the area surrounding Japan, along the entire coast of China up to Russia, then spreading across the Bering Strait east towards the southern coast of Alaska and Canada. They tend to cluster around the central region of Vietnam.\nAdult squid have several distinguishing features. The mantle encloses the visceral mass of the squid, and has two fins, which are not the primary method of propulsion. Instead, the squid has a siphon, a muscle which takes in water from one side, and pushes it out the other side: jet propulsion. The squid has eight arms and two tentacles with suction cups along the backs. In between the arms sits the mouth, or beak. Inside the mouth is a tooth-tongue-like appendage called the radula. Squid have ink sacs, which they use as a defense mechanism against possible predators. Squid also have three hearts.[4]\nThe age of a squid can be determined on the basis of growth rings when additions are appended daily to the statoliths, balance organs in the back of the squid's head. This species of squid can weigh up to 0.5 kg. Mantle length in females can go up to 50 cm; males are smaller.[5]\n",

The order consists of some 300 species and is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beaked mouth at the center point of the eight limbs.[a] The soft body can radically alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.\n",

        "description": "Tiger prawns progress through several life history stages in a short amount of time and mature quickly. Adults live on soft bottoms. Unlike many aquatic invertebrates, tiger prawns reproduce via internal fertilization. After mating, females release hundreds of thousands of fertilized eggs, which quickly hatch. Planktonic larvae live in the open ocean, and juveniles live in estuaries, before moving to the preferred adult habitat near the age of maturation. Like in all decapods, the tiger prawn’s shell really is a skeleton on the outside of its body. The exoskeleton does not expand, and therefore the prawn must molt (or shed) it regularly in order to grow bigger. Before molting, an individual begins building a new, larger skeleton inside the existing one. As it gets too big to be contained, it splits open the outer shell, and the new exoskeleton hardens. During this process, the new exoskeleton can be soft for several hours, and the prawn is highly vulnerable to predation.",
